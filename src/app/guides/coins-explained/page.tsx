        <p className="lead">
          A detailed explanation of the different virtual currencies used in sweepstakes casinos.
          This guide clarifies the roles, acquisition methods, and usage of Gold Coins and
          Sweeps Coins, which are fundamental to the sweepstakes casino model.
        </p>

        <h2>What Are Gold Coins?</h2>
        <p>
          Gold Coins (GC) are the primary play-for-fun currency in sweepstakes casinos.
          They allow you to enjoy the games without any monetary risk. This section will detail
          how Gold Coins are obtained – often through purchases, daily logins, or promotions –
          and emphasize that they hold no direct monetary value and cannot be redeemed for prizes.
          Their purpose is purely for entertainment and experiencing the platform's offerings.
        </p>

        <h2>What Are Sweeps Coins?</h2>
        <p>
          Sweeps Coins (SC), sometimes called Premium Funzpoints or other similar names depending on the platform,
          are the promotional currency that can be redeemed for real prizes, such as cash or gift cards,
          once certain playthrough requirements and minimum balances are met. This section will explain
          how Sweeps Coins are typically acquired – often as a free bonus alongside Gold Coin purchases,
          through mail-in offers, or via social media contests and promotions. We will stress that
          Sweeps Coins cannot usually be purchased directly.
