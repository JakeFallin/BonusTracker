        </p>

        <h2>Gold Coins (GC)</h2>
        <p>
          Virtual currency used for playing games for fun. Gold Coins have no monetary value
          and cannot be redeemed for prizes. They are often available for purchase or given freely
          through daily logins and promotions.
        </p>

        <h2>Sweeps Coins (SC)</h2>
        <p>
          Promotional virtual currency that can be redeemed for real prizes (like cash or gift cards)
          once specific conditions, such as playthrough requirements and minimum balance, are met.
          Sweeps Coins are typically obtained as a free bonus with Gold Coin purchases, through mail-in
          offers, or via contests and promotions.
        </p>

        <h2>Return to Player (RTP)</h2>
        <p>
          The theoretical percentage of all wagered money that a specific game will pay back to players
          over time. For example, a game with a 96% RTP will, on average, return $96 for every $100 wagered.
          It's an indicator of a game's payout behavior over the long run, not a guarantee for individual sessions.
        </p>

        <h2>Playthrough Requirement (Rollover or Wagering Requirement)</h2>
        <p>
          The number of times you must wager your Sweeps Coins before they become eligible for redemption.
          For example, a 1x playthrough on 10 SC means you must make wagers totaling 10 SC before those
          10 SC (or winnings from them) can be redeemed. This is a very common term for any bonus.
        </p>

        <h2>Know Your Customer (KYC)</h2>
        <p>
          The process of verifying a player's identity, typically required before any prize redemption.
          This usually involves submitting documents like a government-issued ID and proof of address
          to comply with legal and regulatory requirements and prevent fraud.
        </p>

        <h2>Alternative Method of Entry (AMOE)</h2>
        <p>
          A way to obtain free Sweeps Coins without making a purchase, most commonly by sending a postal mail request
          according to the casino's specific instructions. This is a key component of the sweepstakes model.
        </p>

        <h2>Volatility (Variance)</h2>
        <p>
          Refers to the risk level associated with a game. High volatility games offer the potential for large wins
          but pay out less frequently. Low volatility games tend to provide smaller, more frequent wins.
          Understanding a game's volatility can help you choose games that match your play style and risk tolerance.
        </p>

        <h2>Redemption</h2>
        <p>
          The process of converting eligible Sweeps Coins into real-world prizes, such as cash transferred to a bank
          account or gift cards.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Familiarizing yourself with these key terms will significantly enhance your understanding and enjoyment
          of sweepstakes casinos.
